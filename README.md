Hi, Iâ€™m @devKarin. 
- I started to study software development in 2020 at a vocational school in Estonia, but after a year I decided to walk self taught path.
- Now I'm a frontend developer intern in a company developing eCommerce solutions. 
- I'm interested in web development and creating special applications.
- Besides main web development tools my stack currently also holds React.js, Svelte, Node.js, MongoDB, MariaDB.
