# Welcome to browse @devKarin's GitHub
You might already figured that I could be a frontend developer. Well, that's true also, but what I actually like is to build projects from front to the back.<br>
I have to say that I prefer to keep most of my projects private until they hatch.

- I'm currently working on a startup idea. I hope to give more information on that very soon.

- Besides main web development tools my stack currently also holds **Python, React.js, Next.js, Svelte, Node.js, MongoDB**.
<br>

## Some big no-no's for me:

- Mandatory office days with social awkwardness and me hiding behind the desk from it and getting no work done even day after that.
- Playing games. I don't play.
